Query Expansion : process of adding additional terms to the original query in order to improve retrieval performance.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

1.) the users‘ initial queries and the retrieved documents based on the user‘s query (top n relevant documents) are analyzed

2.) then the relevant terms from the documents retrieved are weighted

3.) the terms having higher weight and the terms from the previous searches with a greater threshold weight will be selected and are used to derive concepts in the concept network ( graph consisiting of concepts and phrases ) which ae then connected to phrases.

4.) Based on matching of those phrases with the query phrases, additional query terms are selected and based on this the users original query is expanded and the search is enhanced.

1.) Expanding the initial query with new terms and weighting the terms in the expanded query. This can be achieved using following approaches :
	
		i.) based on feedback from the user.

		ii.) based on global information from the document collection.

		iii.) Pseudo relevance feedback ( PRF ) approaches based on info. retrieved from a set of initially retrieved docs. - only those documents which are on the top of the list are considered as relevant.

2.) Construction of user profile
